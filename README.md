# Dijkstra

### Content

Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation for Shortest Path from Source to Target vertices and Visualization of Path from Source to Target and other vertices, edges in the graph

### Running the source file

```sh
# graph file contains lines of adjacent vertices and their distance
# last line contains source and target vertices to find the shortest path
$ python3 dijkstra.py < graph
# Output is .dot and .pdf files. Sample output can be viewed in sample-output directory
```
